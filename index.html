                    love this song. Anyway, today I saw grandma after she came back from vacation.
                    She had loads of fun and even went to a pub till 12:30 AM haha.
                    I ate her place too, helped her make the food and most importantly ordered
                    Martin's present for when I am moving from intern to client at AM.
                    He's done so much for me next to the entirety of AM I just had to get him something.
                    I'm still gonna get the rest a box of chocolates or something. So yeah,
                    Today has been great honestly. Right now I am just vibin' and talking to
                    Zayn again. Tomorrow is another free day, yay!

                <p class="normalText">Today I had a online meeting at AM with my school about
                    the future plans for me at AM. I hope everything goes according to plan.
                    I'm currently listening to BoyWithUke (Fuck you Djesso) and kinda vibin'
                    talking to Zayn right now, I hope he stays and I hold on; he's adorable.
                    Today I also started this project 'cause I thought it'd be a good idea.
                    I didn't give my phone and laptop to the group since I wanted to
                    make this project and just vibe to music. not like they'll take my
                    phone by force anyway. Today was good though, played games.
                    Ate like, half a bread. Haha. I am free tomorrow from work and school
                    so I hope the day will go well.
