                <p class="normalText">Today I had a online meeting at AM with my school about
                    the future plans for me at AM. I hope everything goes according to plan.
                    I'm currently listening to BoyWithUke (Fuck you Djesso) and kinda vibin'
                    talking to Zayn right now, I hope he stays and I hold on; he's adorable.
                    Today I also started this project 'cause I thought it'd be a good idea.
                    I didn't give my phone and laptop to the group since I wanted to
                    make this project and just vibe to music. not like they'll take my
                    phone by force anyway. Today was good though, played games.
                    Ate like, half a bread. Haha. I am free tomorrow from work and school
                    so I hope the day will go well.
